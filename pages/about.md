I'm Daniel. I'm a software engineer working at Facebook on Feed Integrity. I did my undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley as a triple major in Computer Science, Linguistics, and Japanese (and almost got a Korean minor but missed it by one class ㅠㅠ). During my time at Berkeley, I was the head GSI for CS61B (Data Structures) under Paul Hilfinger and Josh Hug. Additionally, I served as one of the co-instructors for the lab-based version of the class, CS61BL during [summer 2017](www.cs61bl.org/su17)

My focuses range far and wide. To name just a few in my specific majors:

- In the words of one of my closest friends, Ajay Tripathi, I lie at the crossroads of EE and CS. I focus primarily on machine learning. Currently I am focused on deep learning, exploring different architecture models and applications.
- My linguistic passions lie in syntax, especially those of East Asian languages, such as Korean and Japanese.
- I am an avid fan of modern Japanese literature, particularly the works of Dazai and Oe.

However, above all, I love teaching. I love to be able to connect with other people through teaching. It never ceases to amaze me how much I get out of teaching, both from what I can give to my students, as well as what I get back from them. Honestly, I believe that you never really know something until you've taught it in some form.

    "If you give a man a fish and you feed him for a day;
    teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."

    "If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men
    and women to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders.
    Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea."

If I have done anything good for society, it was because I was able to instill some sense of love for whatever I was teaching my students.

In my free time, I enjoy doing a variety of things like:

- Listening to [K-pop](/kpop)
- [Dancing](/dance)
- Traveling
- Spending time with friends
- Watching anime and reading manga
    + Some of my personal favorites include Free, Kuroko no Basuke, Keppeki Danshi Aoyama-kun, Magi

I am always looking for ways to learn more and improve myself and inspire others. Feel free to contact me with any questions! There's a link for my information right below.
