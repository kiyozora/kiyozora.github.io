I'm Daniel. I'm currently a senior at UC Berkeley doing a triple major in Computer Science, Linguistics, and Japanese, with a Korean minor. 

I am currently the head GSI for CS61B (Data Structures) under Paul Hilfinger.

My focuses range far and wide when it comes to my course of study. To name just a few in my specific majors:

- In the words of one of my closest friends, Ajay Tripathi, I lie at the crossroads of EE and CS. I focus primarily on machine learning and optimization (both very tightly intertwined). Currently I am focused on neural nets, their designs, limitations, etc. 
- My lingustic passion lie in syntax, especially those of East Asian languages, such as Korean and Japanese. 
- I am an avid fan of modern Japanese literature, particularly the works of Dazai, though recently I have been trying to get deeper into the skin of Oe Kenzaburo.

How do these things all tie together? To be honest, I'm not sure they do and I personally think that they don't have to.

However, above all, I love teaching. I love to be able to connect with other people through teaching. It never ceases to amaze me how much I get out of teaching, both from what I can give to my students, as well as what I get back from them. Honestly, I believe that you never really know something until you've taught it in some form. There's so much I want to say about teaching, but I'll leave you with two quotes that I try to remember.

- There's some saying that if you give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.
- If you want to build a ship, donâ€™t drum up the men and women to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.

If I have done anything good for society, it's because I was able to instill some sense of love for whatever I was teaching my students.

In my free time, I enjoy doing a variety of things like:

- Listening to [K-pop](/kpop)
- [Dancing](/dance)
- Spending time with friends
- Watching anime and reading manga
    + Some of my personal favorites are Free, Kuroko no Basuke, Haikyuu, Magi, Digimon, and Fairy Tail

I am always looking for ways to learn more and improve myself and inspire others. Feel free to contact me with any questions! There's a link for my information right below.
