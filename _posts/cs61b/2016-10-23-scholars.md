A small disclaimer. I use Explain Everything for my lectures. It's a great app for teaching, but exporting the notes as PDFs can be a bit weird. It only exports what is shown on my iPad screan. Ideally if I had more time, I would export multiple times and consolidate into a multipage PDF. I've settled for a hacky solution for the moment which involves me zooming out to see my entire lecture. You should be able to zoom in with no lack of PDF quality and be able to read the notes. At the very least, it is that case when I use Preview on Mac OS.
