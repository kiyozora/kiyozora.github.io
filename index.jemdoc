# jemdoc: menu{MENU}{index.html}
= Daniel Nguyen


If the first line of the fiel starts with +\# jemdoc+, special functions like menus will be used.


== Example
Here are some *text* /features/. I could [http://cvxmod.net/ link somewhere] or insert a raw link to another page like [download.html[. I could use +monospace+, too.
